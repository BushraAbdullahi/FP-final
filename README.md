# Fake News Detection using XGBoost

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project repository. This project demonstrates the use of XGBoost to classify news articles as either "Fake" or "Real." You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook to try out the classifier on your chosen articles.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can follow the installation instructions for your operating system below:

**For Windows:**

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

2. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.

3. Install Jupyter Notebook by running: ``pip install notebook``

**For macOS and Linux:**

1. Jupyter Notebook is often included with scientific Python distributions like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). If you have Anaconda installed, you already have Jupyter Notebook.

2. If you prefer installing Jupyter Notebook via Python's package manager, run: ``pip install notebook``

### Usage

1. Download the zipfile by clicking the green button with the drop down that says '<> Code'

2. Extract the zip file and save the files in your desired location

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your Terminal or Window's command prompt: ``jupyter notebook``

4. In the Jupyter Notebook web interface, open the `search_data.ipynb` file.

5. Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook to try out the classifier on your chosen articles.
